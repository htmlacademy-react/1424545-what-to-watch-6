    comment: `This movie is just plain bad. There must be some big payola going round this awards season. Badly written, average acting at best, all the characters are unrelatable and inlikeable. 2 hours of my life wasted.`,

    comment: `This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction.\nI was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.`,
